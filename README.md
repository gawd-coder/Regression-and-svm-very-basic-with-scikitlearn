# Regression-and-svm-very-basic-with-scikitlearn
1.Took **Stock Data** for this project from **Quandl** </br>
2.Added **Features** accordingly</br>
3.Added **label** accordingly</br>
4.Removed the **NaN** values</br>
5.Trained the model using **Linear Regression model** of **scikit-learn** after splitting the data into **Test Set** and **Training Set**</br>
6.Tested and I got the score **84.79%** (This is low as the training set that I took a small datasize(which I realized later)</br>
7.Then I trained the model with **svm** and got **77.9%** accuracy on testing</br>
